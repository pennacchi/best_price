# Overview
The goal of my project is to allow supermarket customers to spend as little as possible on grocery products. Therefore, we will extract products, prices, and other information from a market and maintain a history of these products. Our customers will have a dashboard where they can search for products and see how the price is changing over time, minimums and maximums, and the current price.
